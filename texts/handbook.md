# Introduction

Hello there

# Why should I play Terresia?

Because you can

# Goal of the Game

### Welcome to Terresia!

Your mission? Plant as many trees as you can while mastering the art of
efficient resource transportation.
Rise to the top of the leaderboard by growing trees and taking bold steps to stop climate change.
The best part? Your gameplay makes an impact—100% of our ad revenue goes toward tree-planting
organizations.
So, play hard, plant smart, and let’s save the planet together. The world’s counting on you!

# Start of the Game

To build structures and plant trees, you'll need resources from the map.

- Click on green bushes to gather seeds. 🌱

- Click on stumps to collect wood. 🪵

Want to take it to the next level? Automate your wood and seed production by constructing
buildings! (Check out the Buildings guide).
Start clicking, start building, and let the forests grow! 🌍✨

# Resources

## Wood

Used to construct buildings.

- Produced in the Sawmill or gathered from limited tree stumps
- Can be traded for gold at Chandler the Trader
- can be carried by mannequins

## Gold

- Used to build buildings, central currency

## Oxygen (O₂)

- Produced by trees planted in garden beds.
- Used as a trade resource and as building requirement

## Seeds

Produced by trees in garden beds.

- Can be used for Composter
- Not to be confused with tree-seeds from the research Lab
- can be carried by mannequins

## Compost

Produced in the Composter.

- Used in the Seed Laboratory and Sawmill
- can be carried by mannequins

## Water

- Produced by well
- requirement for garden beds
- can be carried by mannequins

# Buildings

## Garden Bed

- You can plant trees on garden beds.

- Each tree consumes water and produces oxygen (O₂) and seeds.

- Build additional pathways to transport seeds efficiently.

## Well

Produces water that can be collected by workers and used for tree growth

## Worker Tent

Generates a worker once it’s connected to the path system

Workers are needed to transport any kind of resource

## Composter

Converts seeds into compost, which can be used in the Seed Laboratory and the Sawmill.

- Connect the composter to garden beds and other buildings to optimize production.

## Sawmill

Produces wood from compost.

- Connect it to a composter to ensure a steady supply of compost for wood production.

- Connect to main tent to add your wood to the inventory

## Research Lab

- Allows the player to research new tree types for the garden beds.

- Requires compost

- Connect to main tent to claim new seeds

## Cafeteria

Clicking the cafeteria allows you to enable the Worker Boost, which increases the worker's speed for 5 minutes

## Chandler the Trader

One of the two main buildings

Trade oxygen for wood and gold here to expand your resources.

## Main Tent

One of the two main buildings

Bring wood and seeds made by other buildings here in order to add them to your inventory

# Paths

To link your buildings, you'll need Paths.

Simply select the path build menu to connect one
building to another or expand your existing path network. Easy, right?
But, hold up! Too many paths can overstimulate your workers. Plan carefully to keep things running smoothly and efficiently. Your workers might just thank you for it! 😉
Let’s get those Paths built!🛤️

# Workers

Meet your not-so-genius workers.🤷‍

They might not be the sharpest tools in the shed, but with
a little guidance (and a lot of patience), they’ll get the job
done!

Check out their home base: the Worker Tent. 🏕️
Your mission? Design efficient path systems to keep them moving smoothly and maximize
production. The better your planning, the harder they’ll work! 🚧✨
Be nice to them—they’re trying their best! 😉
